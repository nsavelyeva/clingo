# Clingo

This project is for learning purpose to study how CLI tools can be written in Go language
using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper).

Inspired by [this article](https://carolynvanslyck.com/blog/2020/08/sting-of-the-viper/)
and [this fork](https://github.com/carolynvs/stingoftheviper).

To compile the project and generate the executable file:
```
go build -o clingo
```

To run unit tests:
```

```
